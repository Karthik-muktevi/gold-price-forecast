# gold-price-forecast
ExcelR project
Gold price forecasting is the final project from ExcelR.
In this we have done data preprocessing,Eda,Visualization,model building and finally deployment.
We have tried different model based and data driven models and checked out the error and finalised the model which has the minimum error.
Holts winter exponential smoothing with additive seasonality and additive trend gave the best result.
We have used streamlit to build an application where user can select the number of days to be forecasted and on submit gets the forecasted price as well as the plot of the forecasted prices.
Finally the app is deployed on streamlit.
